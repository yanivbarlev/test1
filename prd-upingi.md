# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Upingi.com

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Project Name

Upingi.com - Software Reviews and Tutorials Hub

### 1.2 Purpose

Upingi.com is a high-quality website focused on software reviews, comparisons, tutorials, and guides, designed to attract traffic via Google search and monetize through Google AdSense ads. The primary goal is to secure AdSense approval by providing valuable, original content and a user-friendly experience, avoiding low-quality or commodity product pages. The site targets software enthusiasts and beginners seeking reliable information.

### 1.3 Background

The project stems from the user's previous attempt to clone a software download site (e.g., Appurse.com), which was rejected by AdSense due to insufficient content quality. The new approach prioritizes unique, high-value content (reviews, comparisons, tutorials, guides) and an impressive, vibrant homepage to enhance user engagement and meet AdSense standards. The user is a novice programmer using Cursor with vibe coding and prefers Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling.
